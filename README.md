# procshape

A Python module for procedural 3D mesh generation with the Panda3D engine.

This is a work in progress and I don't have a clear idea on what the *finished* module would look like. 
It is a byproduct of building up my skills in game development and will usually look messy. 

I'm open to suggestions, feature requests (just file an issue) and if you want to contribute, 
I'm happy to review and accept any pull request, as long as it improves or extends the code, 
in a useful manner (which obviously is an arbitrary metric, set by me).

Some examples of what can be done with it are available at https://www.tizilogic.com
