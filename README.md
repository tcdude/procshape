# procshape

A Python module for procedural 3D mesh generation with the Panda3D engine.

This is a work in progress and I don't have a clear idea on what the *finished* module would look like. 
It is a byproduct of building up my skills in game development and will usually look messy. 

I'm open to suggestions, feature requests and if you want to contribute, I'm happy to accept any pull request, 
as long as it doesn't break the code for my project(s) that use this code.

Some examples of what can be done with it are available at https://www.tizilogic.com
