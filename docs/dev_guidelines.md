## Git

### Branches

Simple structure for one dev: 

* **master** 
    * latest stable version
    * major and minor version tags on release
* **develop**
    * current development version
    * based on ``master``
    * merges into ``master`` with new major version tag
    
### Versioning

* major = merge year
* minor = merge month
* micro = number starting from 0 for each merge in the same year/month combination
